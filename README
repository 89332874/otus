Otus is a monitoring tool that attributes resource utilization to individual services in cluster.
It collects resource information (e.g. CPU usage, memory usage, and disk I/O) of processes of interest,
and visualize them. Especially, it supports many Hadoop services, for example, MapReduce, HDFS and HBase.
The tool is built atop of OpenTSDB (http://opentsdb.net/). The tool contains a plugin to OpenTSDB that collects resource information,
and provides a standalone web front-end to generate visual reports.
